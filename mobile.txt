The KLP48 Member Sorter is highly optimized for mobile devices. It follows a "Mobile-First" design philosophy, ensuring that the interface is not only functional but also premium on small screens.

## ✨ KEY MOBILE FEATURES

### 1. Responsive "Merge Sort" Interface
- **Thumb-Friendly Design:** The comparison cards in `Sorter.jsx` are large and easy to tap, specifically designed for one-handed use.
- **Adaptive Grids:** The layout automatically switches from a side-by-side view (Desktop) to a stacked or high-density grid (Mobile) to prevent horizontal scrolling.

### 2. iOS-Optimized Image Generation
- **Safari Compatibility:** We use specific `html-to-image` configurations (`cacheBust`, `useCORS`, and `pixelRatio`) to ensure that Safari on iOS generates clear screenshots without the common "blank white image" bug.
- **Cross-Origin Support:** Images are handled with `crossOrigin="anonymous"` to satisfy mobile browser security requirements.

### 3. Native Share API (iOS & Android)
- **Direct Integration:** Unlike basic websites that just copy a link, this app triggers the **Native System Share Sheet**.
- **Attachment Support:** On supported mobile devices, clicking "Share to X" actually attaches the generated PNG screenshot directly to the system share menu, allowing users to post images to X, WhatsApp, or Instagram effortlessly.

### 4. Interactive Profile Modals
- **Touch Gestures:** Modals are built with `framer-motion`, providing smooth, app-like transitions and easy "tap-to-close" backdrops that feel natural on touchscreens.
- **Scrolling:** Profile content is scroll-locked when open, preventing the background page from moving while the user reads about a member.

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL OPTIMIZATIONS FOR MOBILE

- **Zustand State Management:** By using a global store instead of URL parameters, we avoid "State Loss" if a mobile browser aggressively hibernates a tab in the background.
- **Viewports:** The `index.html` is configured with `width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0` to ensure perfect scaling on all screen sizes (from iPhone SE to Pro Max).
- **FastClick Simulation:** Tailwind's active states (`active:scale-95`) provide immediate haptic-like visual feedback when a user taps a member card.

## 🚀 VERDICT
The application performs like a **Native Mobile App**. It is fully ready for "Viral" sharing on social media platforms directly from mobile browsers.
